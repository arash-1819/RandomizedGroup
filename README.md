# RandomizedGroup
A silly simple Python to divide my Math and CS students at my workshop at UoR into groups of 3 or if not possible groups of 3s and a maximum of 2 groups of 2.

## How to Run:
cd to the directory of the program

Run one of the following commands depending on your OS:

	Windows:
		python randomizedGroups.py ./<namesFile>
  
	Mac/Linux:
		python3 randomizedGroups.py ./<namesFile>
  
Each name in nameFile must be in separate lines
