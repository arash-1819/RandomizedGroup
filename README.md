# RandomizedGroup
A silly simple python to divide my Math and CS student at my workshop at UoR to groups of 3 or if not possible groups of 3s and maximum of 2 groups of 2.

# How to Run:
- cd to the directory of the program
- run one of the following commands depending on your OS:
	windows:
		python randomizedGroups.py ./<namesFile>
	Mac/Linux:
		python3 randomizedGroups.py ./<namesFile>
- each name in nameFile must be in separate lines
